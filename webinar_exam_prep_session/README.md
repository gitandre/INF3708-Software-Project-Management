## General Guidelines

1. **Exam Duration**: The exam is 2 hours long, not 3 hours. You will also have 30 minutes to collate and submit your work.
2. **Handwriting vs. Typing**: If you have poor handwriting, consider typing your answers even if writing is faster for you.
3. **Answer Structuring**: When answering questions, keep your answers well-structured and coherent. It's helpful to list the key points and then expand on each one.
   - **Example Answer Format**: 
      ```markdown
      **What are 3 strategic options for legacy system evolution?**
      1. **Scrap the System Completely**: [Explanation as per marks]
      2. **Maintain the System**: [Explanation as per marks]
      3. **Reengineer the System**: [Explanation as per marks]
      ```

## Diagrams and Drawings

1. **Manual Diagrams**: Try to master drawing the diagrams manually on paper first.
2. **Diagramming Tools**: Tools like [app.diagrams.net](app.diagrams.net) are allowed, but pre-created templates are probably not allowed.
3. Practice using the tool way before the exam.
3. **New Tabs**: Iris will flag a new tab being opened, but Emil will check whether the new tab is being used appropriately.

## Methodologies and Models

1. **AoA or ADM**: (Insert example here)
2. **PDM or AoN**: (Insert example here)
3. **Waterfall vs. Agile**: Both methodologies seem important.
   - **Identifying Progress**: Consider how progress and completion are identified (requirements vs. testing vs. definition of done).

## Calculations and Notations

1. **Rounding**: Round your final answers, not intermediate steps or calculations.
2. **ROI Calculation**: Use the ROI calculation from the textbook, not from other resources.
3. **Tutorial Letters**: Use your tutorial letters as the source of truth for drawing and calculating answers.

## Specific Areas to Focus On

1. **PMBOK Knowledge Areas**: All 10 PMBOK knowledge areas appear to be very important.
2. **Resource Management**: Especially focus on the people aspect, such as values, beliefs, skills, cultural differences, norms, etc.
3. **Project Details**: The details of a project and customer requirements matter; detailed specification is important.

## Exam Rules and Tips

1. **Iris Extension**: Use Chrome and the Iris extension.
2. **Equipment Testing**: Test all your equipment and systems to ensure they are exam-day ready.
3. **Apparel Restrictions**: Use of earphones or wearing of hats is not allowed.

## Miscellaneous

1. **June/July 2012 Memo**: See May-June 2021 memo.pdf in this directory.
2. **Answering Tips**: Consider the marks and the use of singular vs. plural words when answering questions.
   - **Example**: "Critical path" vs. "Critical paths" for 4 marks.
3. Using Excel online is allowed as per Emil but please note that pre-created templates are not and will be seen as cheating.
4. Emil takes great efforts to identify cheating and often grabs popcorn and reviews each incident raised by Iris for review. i.e dont cheat its not worth it :)
