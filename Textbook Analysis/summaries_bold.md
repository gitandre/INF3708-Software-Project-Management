# Chapter Summaries

## Chapter 1 Summary
Many people and organizations have a new or renewed interest in project management as the number of projects continues to grow and their complexity continues to increase. The success rate of IT projects has more than doubled since 1995, but still only about one-third are successful in meeting scope, time, and cost goals. Using a more disciplined approach to managing projects can help projects and organizations succeed.

A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result. An IT project involves the use of hardware, software, and networks. Projects are unique, temporary, and developed incrementally; they require resources, have a sponsor, and involve uncertainty. The triple constraint of project management refers to managing the scope, time, and cost dimensions of a project. It is important to address these dimensions as well as other constraints (such as quality, resources, and risks) and to satisfy the project sponsor.

Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet project requirements. **Stakeholder**s are the people involved in or affected by project activities. A framework for project management includes the project stakeholders, project management knowledge areas, and project management tools and techniques. The 10

knowledge areas are project integration management, scope, schedule, cost, quality, resource, communications, risk, procurement, and stakeholder management. There are many tools and techniques in each knowledge area. There are different ways to define project success, and project managers must understand the criteria that define success for their unique projects.

A program is a group of related projects, subsidiary programs, and program activities managed in a coordinated way to obtain benefits and control that are not available from managing the projects individually. Project portfolio management involves organizing and managing projects and programs as a portfolio of investments that contribute to the entire enterprise’s success. Portfolio management emphasizes meeting strategic goals, while project management focuses on tactical goals. Studies show that user involvement is crucial to project success, as are other factors like executive support and clear business objectives.

Project managers play a key role in helping projects and organizations succeed. They must perform various job duties, possess many skills, and continue to develop skills in project management, general management, and their application area, such as IT. Soft skills, especially leadership, are particularly important for project managers.

The profession of project management continues to grow and mature. In the United States, the military took the lead in project management and developed many tools such as **Gantt** charts and network diagrams, but today people use project management in virtually every industry around the globe. The **Project Management** Institute (PMI) is an international professional society that provides several certifications and upholds a code of ethics. Today, hundreds of project management software products are available to assist people in managing projects.

## Chapter 2 Summary
Projects operate in an environment broader than the project itself. Project managers need to take a systems approach in order to successfully manage projects; they need to consider projects within the greater organizational context. To ensure project success, IT project managers need to integrate business and organizational issues as well as technology into project planning.

Organizations have four different frames: structural, human resources, political, and symbolic.

Project managers need to understand all of these aspects of organizations to be successful.

The structural frame focuses on different groups’ roles and responsibilities to meet the goals and policies set by top management. The human resources frame focuses on producing harmony between the needs of the organization and the needs of people. The political frame addresses organizational and personal politics. The symbolic frame focuses on symbols and meanings.

The structure of an organization has strong implications for project managers, especially regarding the amount of authority they have. The three basic organizational structures are functional, matrix, and project. Project managers have the most authority in a pure project organization, an intermediate amount of authority in a matrix organization, and the least amount of authority in a pure functional organization.

Organizational culture also affects project management. Projects are more likely to succeed in a culture where employees have a strong identity with the organization, where work activities emphasize groups, and where there is strong unit integration, high risk tolerance, performance-based rewards, high conflict tolerance, an open-systems focus, and a balance among the dimensions of people focus, control, and means orientation.

Project stakeholders are individuals and organizations who are actively involved in the project or whose interests may be positively or negatively affected by the project’s execution or successful completion. Project managers must identify and understand the different needs of all stakeholders involved with their projects.

Top management commitment is crucial for project success. Because projects often affect many areas in an organization, top management must assist project managers if they are to do a good job of project integration. Organizational commitment to IT is also important to the success of IT projects. Development standards and guidelines assist most organizations in managing projects.

A project life cycle is a collection of phases. Traditional project phases include concept, development, implementation, and closeout. Projects often develop products, which follow product life cycles. Project managers must understand the specific life cycles of their products as well as the general project life cycle model.

A project should successfully pass through each project phase in order to continue to the next phase. A management review should occur at the end of each project phase, and more frequent management inputs are often needed. These management reviews and inputs are important for keeping projects on track and determining if projects should be continued, redirected, or terminated.

Project managers need to consider several factors affected by the unique context of IT projects. The diverse nature of these projects and the wide range of business areas and technologies involved make IT projects especially challenging to manage.

## Chapter 3 Summary
Project management involves a number of interlinked processes. The five project management process groups are initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing. These processes occur at varying levels of intensity throughout each phase of a project, and specific outcomes are produced as a result of each process. Normally the executing processes require the most resources and time, followed by the planning processes. Spending adequate time in planning pays off in execution.

Mapping the main activities of each project management process group into the 10 project management knowledge areas provides a big picture of what activities are involved in project management.

It is important to tailor project management methodologies to meet an organization’s particular needs. Some organizations develop their own IT project management methodologies, often using the standards in the **PMBOK**® Guide as a foundation. Popular methods like PRINCE2, **Agile**, RUP, and Six Sigma include project management processes.

The JWD Consulting case study demonstrates how one organization managed an IT project from start to finish. The case study provides samples of outputs produced for initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing:

•Business case

•**Stakeholder** register

•**Stakeholder** management strategy

•Project charter

•Kick-off meeting agenda

•**Team** charter

•Work breakdown structure

•**Gantt** chart

•List of prioritized risks

•**Milestone** report

•Progress report

•Lessons-learned report

•Final project report

The second version of the same case study illustrates how to use **Scrum**, the leading agile method, to manage the project. Instead of releasing the new intranet software just once near the end of the project, the team could release three iterations of the software. This version of the case study introduced some new tools, including a product backlog, sprint backlog, and burndown chart. Later chapters provide detailed information for creating these and other project management documents and using several of the tools and techniques described in both versions of this case study.

## Chapter 4 Summary
Project integration management is usually the most important project management knowledge area, because it ties together all the other areas of project management. A project manager’s primary focus should be on project integration management.

Before selecting projects to pursue, it is important for organizations to follow a strategic planning process. Many organizations perform a SWOT analysis to help identify potential projects based on their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. IT projects should support the organization’s overall business strategy. Common techniques for selecting projects include focusing on broad organizational needs, categorizing projects, performing financial analyses, developing weighted scoring models, and using balanced scorecards.

Project integration management includes the following processes:

•Developing the project charter, which involves working with stakeholders to create the document that formally authorizes a project. Project charters can have different formats, but they should include basic project information and signatures of key stakeholders.

•Creating an assumption log to document and track assumptions throughout the life of the project.

•Developing the project management plan, which involves coordinating all planning efforts to create a consistent, coherent document. The main purpose of project plans is to facilitate action.

•Directing and managing project work, which involves carrying out the project plans by performing the activities included in it. Project plan execution usually requires the majority of a project’s budget.

•Managing project knowledge, which involves using existing knowledge and creating new knowledge to achieve project objectives while also contributing to organizational learning.

•Monitoring and controlling project work, which is necessary to meet the performance objectives of the project. The project team should continuously monitor project performance to assess the overall health of the project.

•Performing integrated change control, which involves identifying, evaluating, and managing changes throughout the project life cycle. A change control system often includes a change control board (CCB), configuration management, and a process for communicating changes.

•Closing the project or phase involves finalizing all project activities. It is important to follow good procedures to ensure that all project activities are completed and that the project sponsor accepts delivery of the final products, services, or results.

Several types of software products are available to assist in project integration management.

Be sure to consider how project integration management can differ in agile/adaptive environments.

## Chapter 5 Summary
Project scope management includes the processes to ensure that the project addresses all the work required to complete the project successfully. The main processes include planning scope management, collecting requirements, defining scope, creating the **WBS**, validating scope, and controlling scope.

The first step in project scope management is planning scope management. The project team reviews information and uses expert judgment and meetings to help create a scope management plan and requirements management plan.

The next step is collecting requirements, a crucial part of many IT projects. It is important to review the project charter and meet with key stakeholders listed in the stakeholder register when collecting requirements. The main outputs of this process are requirements documentation and a requirements traceability matrix.

A project scope statement is created in the scope definition process. This document often includes a product scope description, product user acceptance criteria, detailed information on all project deliverables, and information on project boundaries, constraints, and assumptions.

There are often several versions of the project scope statement to keep scope information detailed and up to date.

A work breakdown structure (**WBS**) is a deliverable-oriented grouping of the work involved in a project that defines its total scope. The **WBS** forms the basis for planning and managing project schedules, costs, resources, and changes. You cannot use project management software without first creating a good **WBS**. A **WBS** dictionary is a document that provides detailed information about each **WBS** item. A good **WBS** is often difficult to create because of the complexity of the project. There are several approaches for developing a **WBS**, including using guidelines, the analogy approach, the top-down approach, the bottom-up approach, and mind mapping.

Validating scope involves formal acceptance of the completed project deliverables.

Controlling scope involves controlling changes to the project scope.

Poor project scope management is one of the key reasons projects fail. For IT projects, it is important for good project scope management to have strong user involvement, executive support, a clear statement of requirements, and a process for managing scope changes.

Many software products are available to assist in project scope management. The **WBS** is a key concept in properly using project management software because it provides the basis for entering tasks.

## Chapter 6 Summary
Project schedule management is often cited as the main source of conflict on projects. Most IT

projects exceed time estimates. The main processes involved in project schedule management include planning schedule management, defining activities, sequencing activities, estimating activity durations, developing the schedule, and controlling the schedule.

Planning schedule management involves determining the policies, procedures, and documentation that will be used for planning, executing, and controlling the project schedule.

The main output is a schedule management plan.

Defining activities involves identifying the specific activities that must be completed to produce the project deliverables. It usually results in a more detailed **WBS**.

Sequencing activities determines the relationships or dependencies between activities.

Three reasons for creating relationships are that they are mandatory based on the nature of the work, discretionary based on the project team’s experience, or external based on non-project activities. Activity sequencing must be done in order to use critical path analysis.

Network diagrams are the preferred technique for showing activity sequencing. The two methods used to create these diagrams are the arrow diagramming method and the precedence diagramming method. There are four types of relationships between tasks: finish-to-start, finish-to-finish, start-to-start, and start-to-finish.

Estimating activity durations creates estimates for the amount of time it will take to complete each activity. These time estimates include the actual amount of time worked plus elapsed time.

Developing the schedule uses results from all of the other project schedule management processes to determine the start and end dates for the project. Project managers often use **Gantt** charts to display the project schedule. Tracking **Gantt** charts show planned and actual schedule information.

The critical path method predicts total project duration. The critical path for a project is the series of activities that determines the earliest completion date for the project. It is the longest path through a network diagram. If any activity on the critical path slips, the whole project will slip unless the project manager takes corrective action.

Crashing and fast tracking are two techniques for shortening project schedules. Project managers and their team members must be careful about accepting unreasonable schedules, especially for IT projects. There is a practical limit to shortening schedules of about 25 percent, and it almost always increases project cost and risk.

Critical chain scheduling is an application of the Theory of **Constraint**s (TOC) that uses critical path analysis, resource constraints, and buffers to help meet project completion dates.

The Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) is a network analysis technique used to estimate project duration when there is a high degree of uncertainty about the individual activity duration estimates. PERT uses optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic estimates of activity durations. PERT is seldom used today.

## Chapter 7 Summary
Project cost management is traditionally a weak area of IT projects. IT project managers must acknowledge the importance of cost management and take responsibility for understanding basic cost concepts, cost estimating, budgeting, and cost control.

Project managers must understand several basic principles of cost management to be effective in managing project costs. Important concepts include profits and profit margins, life cycle costing, cash flow analysis, sunk costs, and learning curve theory.

Planning cost management involves determining the policies, procedures, and documentation that will be used for planning, executing, and controlling project cost. The main output of this process is a cost management plan.

Estimating costs is a very important part of project cost management. There are several types of cost estimates, including rough order of magnitude (ROM), budgetary, and definitive.

Each type of estimate is done during different stages of the project life cycle, and each has a different level of accuracy. Several tools and techniques can help you develop cost estimates, including analogous estimating, bottom-up estimating, parametric estimating, and computerized tools. Function point analysis can also be used to estimate software development costs.

Determining the budget involves allocating costs to individual work items over time. It is important to understand how particular organizations prepare budgets so estimates are made accordingly.

Controlling costs includes monitoring cost performance, reviewing changes, and notifying project stakeholders of changes related to costs. Many basic accounting and finance principles relate to project cost management. Earned value management is an important method used for measuring project performance. Earned value management integrates scope, cost, and schedule information. Project portfolio management allows organizations to collect and control an entire suite of projects or investments as one set of interrelated activities.

Several software products can assist with project cost management. Project 2016 has many cost management features, including earned value management. Enterprise project management software and portfolio management software can help managers evaluate data on multiple projects.

Be sure to consider how project cost management can differ in agile/adaptive environments.

## Chapter 9 Summary
People are the most important assets in organizations and on projects. Therefore, it is essential for project managers to be good human resource managers. They must also make effective use of physical resources.

The major processes of project resource management include planning resources, estimating activity resources, acquiring resources, developing the team, managing the team, and controlling resources.

Psychosocial issues that affect how people work and how well they work include motivation, influence and power, and effectiveness.

Maslow developed a hierarchy of needs that suggests physiological, safety, social, esteem, and self-actualization needs motivate behavior. Once a need is satisfied, it no longer serves as a motivator.

Herzberg distinguished between motivators and hygiene factors. Hygiene factors such as larger salaries or a more attractive work environment will cause dissatisfaction if not present, but do not motivate workers to do more if present. Achievement, recognition, the work itself, responsibility, and growth are factors that contribute to work satisfaction and motivating workers.

McClelland proposed the acquired-needs theory, suggesting that a person’s needs are acquired or learned over time and shaped by their life experiences. The three types of acquired needs are a need for achievement, a need for affiliation, and a need for power.

McGregor developed Theory X and Theory Y to describe different approaches to managing workers, based on assumptions of worker motivation. Research supports the use of Theory Y, which assumes that people see work as natural and indicates that the most significant rewards are the satisfaction of esteem and self-actualization needs that work can provide. According to Ouchi’s Theory Z, workers can be trusted to do their jobs to their utmost ability as long as management supports them and looks out for their well-being. Theory Z emphasizes job rotation, broadening of skills, generalization versus specialization, and the need for continuous training of workers.

Thamhain and Wilemon identified nine influence bases available to project managers: authority, assignment, budget, promotion, money, penalty, work challenge, expertise, and friendship. Their research found that project success is associated with project managers who use work challenge and expertise to influence workers. Project failure is associated with placing too much emphasis on authority, money, or penalty.

Power is the ability to influence behavior to get people to do things they would not otherwise do. The five main types of power are coercive power, legitimate power, expert power, reward power, and referent power.

Project managers can use Stephen Covey’s seven habits of highly effective people to help themselves and project teams become more effective. The seven habits include being proactive; beginning with the end in mind; putting first things first; thinking win/win; seeking first to understand, then to be understood; achieving synergy; and sharpening the saw. Using empathic listening is a key skill of good project managers.

Emotional intelligence is also an important concept. It involves knowing and managing one’s own emotions and those of others for improved performance.

## Chapter 11 Summary
**Risk** is an uncertainty that can have a negative or positive effect on meeting project objectives.

Many organizations do a poor job of project risk management, if they do any at all. Successful organizations realize the value of good project risk management.

**Risk** management is an investment; in other words, costs are associated with identifying risks, analyzing those risks, and establishing plans to address them. Those costs must be included in cost, schedule, and resource planning.

**Risk** utility or risk tolerance is the amount of satisfaction or pleasure received from a potential payoff. **Risk** seekers enjoy high risks, risk-averse people do not like to take risks, and risk-neutral people seek to balance risks and potential payoff.

Project risk management is a process in which the project team continually assesses what risks may negatively or positively affect the project, determines the probability of such events occurring, and determines the impact if such events occur. **Risk** management also involves analyzing and determining alternate strategies to deal with risks. The processes of risk management are planning risk management, identifying risks, performing qualitative risk analysis, performing quantitative risk analysis, planning risk responses, implementing risk responses, and monitoring risks.

Planning risk management is the process of deciding how to approach risk management activities and plan for them in a project. Contingency plans are predefined actions that a project team will take if an identified risk event occurs. Fallback plans are developed for risks that have a high impact on meeting project objectives and are implemented if attempts to reduce the risk are not effective. Contingency reserves or contingency allowances are provisions held by the project sponsor or organization to reduce the risk of cost or schedule overruns to an acceptable level.

IT projects often involve several risks, including lack of user involvement, lack of executive management support, unclear requirements, and poor planning. Lists developed by the Standish Group and other organizations can help you identify potential risks on IT projects.

A risk breakdown structure is a useful tool that can help project managers consider potential risks in different categories. Lists of common risk conditions in project management knowledge areas can also be helpful in identifying risks, as can techniques such as brainstorming, the Delphi technique, interviewing, and SWOT analysis. A risk register is a document that contains results of various risk management processes; it is often displayed in a table or spreadsheet format. A risk register is a tool for documenting potential risk events and related information.

**Risk** events refer to specific, uncertain events that may occur to the detriment or enhancement of the project.

**Risk**s can be assessed qualitatively and quantitatively. Tools for qualitative risk analysis include a probability/impact matrix and the Top Ten **Risk** Item Tracking technique. Tools for quantitative risk analysis include decision trees and Monte Carlo simulation. Expected monetary value (EMV) uses decision trees to evaluate potential projects based on their expected value.

Simulations are a more sophisticated method for creating estimates to help you determine the likelihood of meeting specific project schedule or cost goals. Sensitivity analysis is used to show the effects of changing one or more variables on an outcome.

## Chapter 13 Summary
Managing stakeholders is the tenth knowledge area in the **PMBOK**® Guide – Sixth Edition.

Project stakeholder management includes identifying stakeholders, planning stakeholder engagement, managing stakeholder engagement, and monitoring stakeholder engagement.

You cannot perform the other stakeholder management processes until you first identify project stakeholders. **Stakeholder**s can be internal or external to the organization, and they might support or oppose your project. The main output of this process is a stakeholder register.

A stakeholder analysis is a key technique used in planning stakeholder engagement. Some information, such as how to manage relationships with stakeholders, might be sensitive, so it must be handled carefully. A stakeholder management plan describes stakeholder engagement levels, interrelationships, communication requirements, management strategies, and a process for updating the plan.

When managing stakeholder engagement, project managers and their teams must understand various expectations of stakeholders and use their communications and interpersonal skills. It is important to encourage engagement early in a project and have deliverables that require engagement. An important output of this process is updating the issue log—a document used to help track and resolve issues on projects.

It is important to monitor stakeholder engagement by having an open dialogue and tracking deliverables related to engagement.

Several types of software can assist in project stakeholder management. In addition to technologies mentioned in other chapters to improve communications and collaboration, social media can also help in developing relationships with stakeholders. Some project management software applications include features inspired by social media, such as giving “high fives” and posting comment threads.

Be sure to consider how project integration management can differ in agile/adaptive environments.
