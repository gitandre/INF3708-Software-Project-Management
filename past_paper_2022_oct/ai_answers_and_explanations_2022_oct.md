## Question 1

### Case Study
The department of a big car manufactory company (Car Trace) you are working
for wants to grant a contract to an IT company called “Highway IT” for the
upgrade of their largest financial system. This system is used by other support
departments that interact with them. However, before the Car Trace
management can endorse the IT project, the project has to be evaluated by the
finance department to ensure its viability and benefits for the company in years
to come. The financial department awaits this upgrade as it is becoming a
challenge for other departments and people to interact effectively with them.
The Car Trace management is aware that the finance department needs a
better system for the effective running of the company and has given their
approval for the upgrade with any project that provides the best financial outlook
after financial analysis. However, the management is not sure if the project
proposed by the financial department is the most appropriate or if the
department should consider the alternative project the management have in
mind.
Parties (which are other departments like procurement, auditing, and
reimbursement) need to outline and agree on what the system will cover before
the project iteration starts. This will help the management ensure that the
financial system will accommodate other departments. Since various
departments will interact with a module of the system, there might be a need
for frequent changes during the development stage. Consequently, the finance
department wants a working system to be delivered at the end of each iteration
to enable various departments to practice with their aspects of the system and
come up with any changes.


#### 1.1 Given the information on the case scenario identify who the project stakeholders are. (4 marks)

# Question 2

Table 1: Projects Cash Flow (in South Africa Rand R)

| Year | Project 1 | Project 2 |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| 0    | -R200 000 | -R275 000 |
| 1    | +R85 000  | +R70 000  |
| 2    | +R70 000  | +R75 000  |
| 3    | +R78 000  | +R80 000  |
| 4    | +R33 000  | +R85 000  |


Based on the information provided in Table 1 answer questions 2.1 to 2.3
below:


#### 2.1 Calculate the net profit for the two projects. (5 marks)
**Answer:**
Net Profit for Project 1: R66,000  
Net Profit for Project 2: R35,000

**Explanation:**
The net profit is calculated by summing up all the cash flows for each project. For Project 1, we add up (-R200,000) + R85,000 + R70,000 + R78,000 + R33,000, which equals R66,000. Similarly, for Project 2, we sum up (-R275,000) + R70,000 + R75,000 + R80,000 + R85,000, which equals R35,000. The net profit indicates the overall financial gain or loss from the project.

---

#### 2.2 Calculate the Return on Investment (ROI) for the two projects. (5 marks)
**Answer:**
ROI for Project 1: 33.00%  
ROI for Project 2: 12.73%

**Explanation:**
Return on Investment (ROI) is calculated using the formula:

ROI = (Net Profit / Initial Investment) x 100

For Project 1, the initial investment is R200,000, and the net profit is R66,000. Plugging these into the formula gives:

ROI = (66,000 / 200,000) x 100 = 33.00%

Similarly, for Project 2, the initial investment is R275,000, and the net profit is R35,000. The ROI is:

ROI = (35,000 / 275,000) x 100 = 12.73%

The ROI percentage tells you how much return you got on your initial investment. A higher percentage is generally better, indicating a more profitable project.

---

#### 2.3 Calculate which year each of the projects will payback its capital investment. (5 marks)
**Answer:**
Payback Year for Project 1: Year 3  
Payback Year for Project 2: Year 4

**Explanation:**
The payback year is determined by tracking the running total of cash flows from Year 0 onwards until it becomes positive.

- For Project 1:  
  - Year 0: -R200,000  
  - Year 1: -R115,000 (Year 0 + R85,000)  
  - Year 2: -R45,000  (Year 1 + R70,000)  
  - Year 3: +R33,000  (Year 2 + R78,000)

So, by Year 3, the accumulated cash flow turns positive, meaning the initial investment is recovered by then.

- For Project 2:  
  - Year 0: -R275,000  
  - Year 1: -R205,000 (Year 0 + R70,000)  
  - Year 2: -R130,000 (Year 1 + R75,000)  
  - Year 3: -R50,000  (Year 2 + R80,000)  
  - Year 4: +R35,000  (Year 3 + R85,000)

By Year 4, the accumulated cash flow becomes positive, indicating the initial investment is recovered.

The payback year helps to understand how quickly an investment will be recovered through the project's cash flows.

### The main formulae used in Question 2 are:

    Net Profit Calculation
    Return on Investment (ROI)
    Payback Period Calculation

# Question 3 Answers

#### 3.1 Why would you consider Net Present Value (NPV) over net profit as one of the primary methods for projecting financial viability of a project? (3 marks)

**Answer:**  
Net Present Value (NPV) is often considered a more accurate measure of a project's financial viability than net profit because it takes into account the time value of money. In other words, it discounts future cash flows back to their value in present terms, which provides a more comprehensive view of a project's profitability.

#### 3.2 Given a discount rate of 8% in Table 2 below; calculate the Net Present Value (NPV) for projects 1 and 2. Use the cash flow in Table 1 above. (8 marks)

Table 2:
| Year | 8% Discount rate |
|------|-------------------|
| 1  | 0.9259              |
| 2  | 0.8573              |
| 3  | 0.7938              |
| 4  | 0.735               |


**Answer:**  
NPV for Project 1: R 52,162.94  
NPV for Project 2: R -32,681.88  

**Explanation:**  
Net Present Value (NPV) is calculated using the formula:  
NPV = Sum of (Cash Flow in Year N / (1 + Discount Rate)^N)  
Here, N is the year number.

For Project 1:  
NPV = (R85,000 * 0.9259) + (R70,000 * 0.8573) + (R78,000 * 0.7938) + (R33,000 * 0.735) - R200,000  
NPV = R52,162.94  

For Project 2:  
NPV = (R70,000 * 0.9259) + (R75,000 * 0.8573) + (R80,000 * 0.7938) + (R85,000 * 0.735) - R275,000  
NPV = R -32,681.88

#### 3.3 Based on your calculations in questions 2.1 – 2.3 and 3.2, write a paragraph explaining to the company management which of the projects you recommend for the company to invests in (that is a project that is most financially viable). (4 marks)

**Answer:**  
Based on the calculations, Project 1 is the most financially viable option for the company to invest in. Not only does it have a higher Net Profit and Return on Investment (ROI), but it also has a positive Net Present Value (NPV). On the other hand, Project 2 has a negative NPV, making it a less attractive investment.

#### 3.4 Assuming the management of Car Trace has many criteria that are necessary for them to make decision on project selection. Using the information in table 3, calculate the weighted scoring for the project and use the result to support your decision in question 3.3. (6 marks)

table 3:
| Criteria | Weight | Project 1 | Project 2 |
|----------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| A        | 20%    | 50         | 45         |
| B        | 35%    | 70         | 30         |
| C        | 40%    | 40         | 50         |
| D        | 10%    | 90         | 60         |
| Weighted project score        |     |          |          |

**Answer:**  
Weighted Score for Project 1: 59.5  
Weighted Score for Project 2: 46.5  

**Explanation:**  
The weighted scoring is calculated as:  
Weighted Score = (Score in Criteria A * Weight of Criteria A) + (Score in Criteria B * Weight of Criteria B) + ...  

For Project 1:  
Weighted Score = (50 * 0.2) + (70 * 0.35) + (40 * 0.4) + (90 * 0.1)  
Weighted Score = 59.5  

For Project 2:  
Weighted Score = (45 * 0.2) + (30 * 0.35) + (50 * 0.4) + (60 * 0.1)  
Weighted Score = 46.5  

Given the higher weighted score, Project 1 further supports its case as the most financially viable project to invest in.

# Question 4 Answers

## Case Study Context
The department of a big car manufactory company (Car Trace) is in need of an upgrade for their largest financial system. The project needs evaluation by the finance department to ensure its viability. Different departments such as procurement, auditing, and reimbursement are involved, and the system needs to accommodate their needs. The finance department wants a working system at the end of each iteration.

#### 4.1 Which development life cycle approach would you recommend as the most appropriate for Highway IT to use? (5 marks)

**Answer:**  
I would recommend the Agile development life cycle approach for Highway IT.

**Justification:**  
1. Various departments are involved, each with unique needs, which suggests a requirement for flexibility - a key advantage of Agile.
2. The finance department wants a working system at the end of each iteration, aligning with Agile's iterative delivery model.

###3 4.2 Provide a brief description of the prescriptive system development life cycle model you will not recommend for the Highway IT development team. (5 marks)

**Answer:**  
I would not recommend the Waterfall model.

**Justification:**  
1. Waterfall is rigid and doesn't allow for much change, which is contrary to the case study's requirement for accommodating diverse departmental needs.
2. In Waterfall, a working system is only available at the end, which conflicts with the finance department's need for a system at the end of each iteration.

# Question 5 Answers

#### 5.1 Construct a Network Diagram (Activity-on-Arrow)

##### Forward Pass Calculations

Forward pass is a technique to move through the project network diagram from the start to the end, calculating the earliest start and finish times for each activity.

1. **Activity A**: ES (Earliest Start) = 0, EF (Earliest Finish) = 0 + 2 = 2
2. **Activity B**: ES = 2 (EF of A), EF = 2 + 6 = 8
3. **Activity C**: ES = 2 (EF of A), EF = 2 + 6 = 8
4. **Activity D**: ES = 8 (EF of B), EF = 8 + 4 = 12
5. **Activity E**: ES = 8 (EF of B), EF = 8 + 3 = 11
6. **Activity F**: ES = 8 (EF of C), EF = 8 + 4 = 12
7. **Activity G**: ES = 12 (EF of D), EF = 12 + 1 = 13
8. **Activity H**: ES = 12 (EF of D), EF = 12 + 2 = 14
9. **Activity I**: ES = 13 (EF of G), EF = 13 + 3 = 16
10. **Activity J**: ES = 14 (EF of H), EF = 14 + 2 = 16

##### Backward Pass Calculations

Backward pass is a technique to move through the project network diagram from the end to the start, calculating the latest start and finish times for each activity.

1. **Activity J**: LF (Latest Finish) = 16 (Project Completion Time), LS (Latest Start) = 16 - 2 = 14
2. **Activity I**: LF = 16 (LF of J), LS = 16 - 3 = 13
3. **Activity H**: LF = 14 (LS of J), LS = 14 - 2 = 12
4. **Activity G**: LF = 13 (LS of I), LS = 13 - 1 = 12
5. **Activity F**: LF = 14 (LS of J), LS = 14 - 4 = 10
6. **Activity E**: LF = 14 (LS of J), LS = 14 - 3 = 11
7. **Activity D**: LF = 12 (LS of G and H), LS = 12 - 4 = 8
8. **Activity C**: LF = 10 (LS of F), LS = 10 - 6 = 4
9. **Activity B**: LF = 8 (LS of D and E), LS = 8 - 6 = 2
10. **Activity A**: LF = 2 (LS of B and C), LS = 2 - 2 = 0

##### Float Calculations

Float (or Slack) for each activity is calculated as either LF - EF or LS - ES. It indicates the amount of time an activity can be delayed without delaying the project.

1. A: 0, B: 0, C: 2, D: 0, E: 3, F: 2, G: 0, H: 0, I: 0, J: 0

#### 5.2 Indicate the Critical Path on the Network Diagram and Its Durations

The critical path is the sequence of stages determining the minimum time needed for an operation. It is A - B - D - G - I - J with a duration of 16 days.

#### 5.3 Indicate the Total and/or the Free Slack

- **Total Slack**: A: 0, B: 0, C: 2, D: 0, E: 3, F: 2, G: 0, H: 0, I: 0, J: 0
- **Free Slack**: A: 0, B: 0, C: 0, D: 0, E: 0, F: 0, G: 0, H: 0, I: 0, J: 0

The critical path activities (A, B, D, G, I, J) have zero total and free slack, meaning they can't be delayed without delaying the project. Activities C, E, and F have some slack and can be delayed without affecting the project's completion time.
