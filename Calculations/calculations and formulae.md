### return on investment (ROI)

A method for determining the financial value of a project; the ROI is the result of subtracting the project costs from the benefits and then dividing by the costs.

Formula: ROI = (Net Profit / Cost of Investment) x 100

Example Calculation: ROI = (200,000 / 100,000) x 100 = 200%

---

### Net Present Value (NPV)

The difference between the present value of cash inflows (revenue or benefits) and the present value of cash outflows (costs or investments).

Formula: NPV = âˆ‘ (Cash inflow / (1+r)^t) - Initial Investment

Example Calculation: NPV = (100 / (1+0.1)^1) + (100 / (1+0.1)^2) - 150 = -9.09

### Critical Path

The longest path through a network diagram that determines the shortest amount of time in which a project can be completed.

Formula: None

Example Calculation: Based on Network Diagram

---

### Gantt Chart

A horizontal bar chart that represents a project plan over time.

Formula: None

Example Calculation: Based on Project Schedule

---

### Earned Value (EV)

An estimate of the work performed expressed in terms of the budget authorized for that work.

Formula: EV = % of completed work x BAC (Budget at Completion)

Example Calculation: EV = 0.5 x 200,000 = 100,000

---

### Schedule Variance (SV)

The difference between the Earned Value (EV) and the Planned Value (PV).

Formula: SV = EV - PV

Example Calculation: SV = 100,000 - 90,000 = 10,000

---

### Cost Variance (CV)

The difference between the Earned Value (EV) and the Actual Cost (AC).

Formula: CV = EV - AC

Example Calculation: CV = 100,000 - 95,000 = 5,000

---

### Cost Performance Index (CPI)

A measure of cost efficiency in project performance.

Formula: CPI = EV / AC

Example Calculation: CPI = 100,000 / 95,000 = 1.05

---

### Schedule Performance Index (SPI)

A measure of schedule efficiency in project performance.

Formula: SPI = EV / PV

Example Calculation: SPI = 100,000 / 90,000 = 1.11
