# Study Guide for Software Project Management - Chapter 3
### Unique GUID: 321987

---

## Objectives

1. Understand the role of economic feasibility and risk assessment in software project management.
2. Learn about various financial metrics used in project evaluation.
3. Gain insights into risk management strategies.
4. Recognize the importance of prioritizing risks in project planning.
5. Understand the value of Net Present Value (NPV) and Risk Priority Number (RPN) in project management.

---

## Key Terms

- **Economic Feasibility**: Evaluation of a project's financial viability.
- **Risk Assessment**: Systematic process of evaluating the potential risks that may be involved in a projected activity or undertaking.
- **Net Present Value (NPV)**: A financial metric used in capital budgeting to evaluate the profitability of an investment or project.
- **Risk Priority Number (RPN)**: A metric used to prioritize risks based on their severity, occurrence, and detection.
- **Discount Rate**: The interest rate used in calculating the present value of future cash flows.
- **Cash Flows**: The net amount of cash being transferred in and out during a particular period.

---

## Calculations

### Net Present Value (NPV)

- **Definition**: Used in economic feasibility to evaluate the profitability of an investment or project.
- **Formula**: NPV = Sum of (Rt / (1 + i) ^ t) for t from 0 to n
- **Units**: Currency (e.g., Dollars, Pounds, Euros)
- **Variables**: 
  - Rt = Cash inflow or outflow at time t (Currency)
  - i = Discount rate (Percentage)
  - t = Time period (Years)
  - n = Total number of time periods (Years)

### Risk Priority Number (RPN)

- **Definition**: Used in risk assessment to prioritize risks based on their severity, occurrence, and detection.
- **Formula**: RPN = Severity (S) x Occurrence (O) x Detection (D)
- **Units**: Score (unitless)
- **Variables**: 
  - S = Severity of the risk (Score)
  - O = Occurrence likelihood (Score)
  - D = Detection difficulty (Score)

## Summary

Chapter 3 delves into the economic feasibility of projects and risk assessment. It emphasizes the importance of evaluating a project's financial viability using metrics like Net Present Value (NPV). The chapter also discusses risk management strategies and introduces the concept of Risk Priority Number (RPN) for prioritizing risks.

---

## Review Questions

1. What is economic feasibility and how is it evaluated?
2. Explain the role of Net Present Value (NPV) in project evaluation.
3. What is Risk Priority Number (RPN) and how is it calculated?
4. Describe some common risk management strategies.
5. How do you prioritize risks in a project?

---

## Exercises

1. Calculate the NPV for a project given a discount rate of 5% and cash inflows of $1000, $2000, and $3000 over three years.
2. Discuss a project that faced significant risks and how those risks were managed.
3. Research a project that failed due to poor economic feasibility. Explain what went wrong.
4. Role-play a risk assessment meeting and prioritize risks using RPN.

---

## Review Questions - Answers

1. Economic feasibility is the evaluation of a project's financial viability. It is often evaluated using financial metrics such as NPV.
2. NPV is a financial metric that calculates the present value of all future cash flows of a project. It's used to evaluate the profitability of an investment or project.
3. RPN is a numeric assessment that helps prioritize risks based on their severity, occurrence, and detection. It is calculated using the formula RPN = S x O x D.
4. Common risk management strategies include risk avoidance, risk reduction, risk sharing, and risk retention.
5. Risks are prioritized using metrics such as RPN which takes into account severity, occurrence, and detection.

## Exercises - Answers

1. 
  - First year: NPV = $1000 / (1 + 0.05) = $952.38
  - Second year: NPV = $2000 / (1 + 0.05)^2 = $1814.06
  - Third year: NPV = $3000 / (1 + 0.05)^3 = $2593.85
  - Total NPV = $952.38 + $1814.06 + $2593.85 = $5360.29

2. In the healthcare sector, a software project to develop an electronic health record system faced significant data security risks. These risks were managed through encryption, multi-factor authentication

, and regular audits.

3. A smartphone application project failed due to poor economic feasibility. The NPV was not considered, and the project ran out of funds before completion.

4. In a role-play risk assessment meeting, identify the project manager, stakeholders, and discuss various project risks. Prioritize them using RPN. For instance, if a risk has an RPN of 64 and another has an RPN of 48, the first risk would be prioritized.
