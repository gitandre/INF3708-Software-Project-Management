#### Summary

Chapter 5 delves into various aspects of project scope management. It focuses on how changes in scope can influence the ability to meet project time and cost goals. It also highlights the importance of the project charter in setting the high-level scope, time, and cost objectives for the project. The chapter provides insights into how conditions or capabilities needed by a user influence the project's objectives. It also briefly discusses the role of the project manager in ensuring project success.

## Chapter 5 Summary - from textbook
Project scope management includes the processes to ensure that the project addresses all the work required to complete the project successfully. The main processes include planning scope management, collecting requirements, defining scope, creating the WBS, validating scope, and controlling scope.

The first step in project scope management is planning scope management. The project team reviews information and uses expert judgment and meetings to help create a scope management plan and requirements management plan.

The next step is collecting requirements, a crucial part of many IT projects. It is important to review the project charter and meet with key stakeholders listed in the stakeholder register when collecting requirements. The main outputs of this process are requirements documentation and a requirements traceability matrix.

A project scope statement is created in the scope definition process. This document often includes a product scope description, product user acceptance criteria, detailed information on all project deliverables, and information on project boundaries, constraints, and assumptions.

There are often several versions of the project scope statement to keep scope information detailed and up to date.

A work breakdown structure (WBS) is a deliverable-oriented grouping of the work involved in a project that defines its total scope. The WBS forms the basis for planning and managing project schedules, costs, resources, and changes. You cannot use project management software without first creating a good WBS. A WBS dictionary is a document that provides detailed information about each WBS item. A good WBS is often difficult to create because of the complexity of the project. There are several approaches for developing a WBS, including using guidelines, the analogy approach, the top-down approach, the bottom-up approach, and mind mapping.

Validating scope involves formal acceptance of the completed project deliverables.

Controlling scope involves controlling changes to the project scope.

Poor project scope management is one of the key reasons projects fail. For IT projects, it is important for good project scope management to have strong user involvement, executive support, a clear statement of requirements, and a process for managing scope changes.

Many software products are available to assist in project scope management. The WBS is a key concept in properly using project management software because it provides the basis for entering tasks.

#### Review Questions - Answers

1. Project scope management involves defining and controlling what is included and what is not included in a project. It is important for ensuring that the project objectives are met within the agreed-upon constraints.
2. Scope changes can have a significant impact on a project’s time and cost goals. These changes often require additional resources and time, affecting the project's budget and timeline.
3. A condition or capability needed by a user refers to a specific requirement that must be fulfilled for the user to achieve their objective. It could be a feature or functionality in a software project.
4. The project charter serves as a preliminary delineation of roles and responsibilities, outlines the project’s key objectives, and provides a high-level guide for decision-making throughout the project.
5. The project manager plays a pivotal role in achieving the project's objectives. They are responsible for managing all aspects of the project, including scope, to ensure that the project meets its goals.

#### Exercises - Answers

1. For a software development project, potential scope changes could include adding new features or modifying existing ones. These changes could lead to increased development time and costs.
2. In a role-played project scope management meeting, the project manager and stakeholders could discuss potential scope changes and their implications. For instance, adding a new feature could extend the project timeline by two weeks.
3. A mobile app development project failed due to poor scope management. The project kept adding new features without adjusting the timeline or budget, eventually leading to project failure.
4. Drafting a project charter for a software development project would involve defining the project’s scope, objectives, and deliverables. It would also include setting the project timeline and budget and outlining the roles and responsibilities of the project team.
