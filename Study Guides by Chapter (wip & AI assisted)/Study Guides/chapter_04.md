- **Budgeting**: The act of allocating funds for various aspects of a project.
- **Discount Rate**: The interest rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows.
- **Discount Factor**: A factor by which future cash flows are multiplied to get their present value.
- **Discounted Costs**: The present value of future costs, calculated using a discount rate.
- **Benefits**: The advantages or gains expected from a project.
- **Discounted Benefits**: The present value of future benefits, calculated using a discount rate.
- **Net Present Value (NPV)**: The difference between the present value of cash inflows (benefits) and the present value of cash outflows (costs).
- **Cumulative Benefits**: The total benefits accumulated over time.
- **Return on Investment (ROI)**: The benefit or return gained from an investment.

## Calculations

### Discount Rate

- **Definition**: The interest rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows.
- **Formula**: 
  - Discount Rate = (Future Value / Present Value) - 1
- **Units**: Percentage (%)
- **Variables**: 
  - Future Value = The value of an investment at a future time (Currency)
  - Present Value = The current value of an investment (Currency)

### Discount Factor

- **Definition**: A factor used to discount future cash flows to their present value.
- **Formula**: 
  - Discount Factor = 1 / (1 + Discount Rate) ^ Time
- **Units**: Unitless
- **Variables**: 
  - Time = Time in years
  - Discount Rate = Interest rate for discounting (%)

### Discounted Costs

- **Definition**: The present value of future costs.
- **Formula**: 
  - Discounted Costs = Future Costs / (1 + Discount Rate) ^ Time
- **Units**: Currency (e.g., Dollars, Pounds, Euros)
- **Variables**: 
  - Future Costs = Costs that will be incurred in the future (Currency)
  - Time = Time in years
  - Discount Rate = Interest rate for discounting (%)

### Benefits and Discounted Benefits

- **Definition (Benefits)**: The advantages or gains expected from a project.
- **Definition (Discounted Benefits)**: The present value of future benefits.
- **Formula**: 
  - Discounted Benefits = Future Benefits / (1 + Discount Rate) ^ Time
- **Units**: Currency (e.g., Dollars, Pounds, Euros)
- **Variables**: 
  - Future Benefits = Benefits that will be gained in the future (Currency)
  - Time = Time in years
  - Discount Rate = Interest rate for discounting (%)

### Net Present Value (NPV)

- **Definition**: The difference between the present value of cash inflows (benefits) and the present value of cash outflows (costs).
- **Formula**: 
  - NPV = Discounted Benefits - Discounted Costs
- **Units**: Currency (e.g., Dollars, Pounds, Euros)

### Cumulative Benefits

- **Definition**: The total benefits accumulated over time.
- **Formula**: 
  - Cumulative Benefits = Sum of Benefits over Time
- **Units**: Currency (e.g., Dollars, Pounds, Euros)

### Return on Investment (ROI)

- **Definition**: The benefit or return gained from an investment.
- **Formula**: 
  - ROI = (Cumulative Benefits - Total Costs) / Total Costs
- **Units**: Percentage (%)

## Summary

Chapter 4 focuses on project cost estimation, budgeting, and the role of discounting in project evaluation. It explains the importance of accurately estimating the costs and benefits of a project to determine its economic viability. Various methods for calculating discounted costs and benefits are presented, along with key metrics like Net Present Value (NPV) and Return on Investment (ROI).

## Chapter 4 Summary - from textbook
Project integration management is usually the most important project management knowledge area, because it ties together all the other areas of project management. A project manager’s primary focus should be on project integration management.

Before selecting projects to pursue, it is important for organizations to follow a strategic planning process. Many organizations perform a SWOT analysis to help identify potential projects based on their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. IT projects should support the organization’s overall business strategy. Common techniques for selecting projects include focusing on broad organizational needs, categorizing projects, performing financial analyses, developing weighted scoring models, and using balanced scorecards.

Project integration management includes the following processes:

•Developing the project charter, which involves working with stakeholders to create the document that formally authorizes a project. Project charters can have different formats, but they should include basic project information and signatures of key stakeholders.

•Creating an assumption log to document and track assumptions throughout the life of the project.

•Developing the project management plan, which involves coordinating all planning efforts to create a consistent, coherent document. The main purpose of project plans is to facilitate action.

•Directing and managing project work, which involves carrying out the project plans by performing the activities included in it. Project plan execution usually requires the majority of a project’s budget.

•Managing project knowledge, which involves using existing knowledge and creating new knowledge to achieve project objectives while also contributing to organizational learning.

•Monitoring and controlling project work, which is necessary to meet the performance objectives of the project. The project team should continuously monitor project performance to assess the overall health of the project.

•Performing integrated change control, which involves identifying, evaluating, and managing changes throughout the project life cycle. A change control system often includes a change control board (CCB), configuration management, and a process for communicating changes.

•Closing the project or phase involves finalizing all project activities. It is important to follow good procedures to ensure that all project activities are completed and that the project sponsor accepts delivery of the final products, services, or results.

Several types of software products are available to assist in project integration management.

Be sure to consider how project integration management can differ in agile/adaptive environments.

## Exercises - Answers

1. 
  - Discount Factor = 1 / (1 + 0.05) ^ 3
  - Discount Factor = 1 / (1.05) ^ 3
  - Discount Factor = 1 / 1.157625
  - Discount Factor = 0.8638376

2. A software project can go over-budget due to unforeseen challenges, scope creep, and poor planning. Preventive measures include strict monitoring, contingency planning, and stakeholder communication.

3. A mobile app project failed due to poor cost estimation. Costs were underestimated, leading to a shortfall in funding and ultimately project failure.

4. In a budgeting role-play, factors to consider would include labor costs, software and hardware costs, operational costs, and contingency funds.
