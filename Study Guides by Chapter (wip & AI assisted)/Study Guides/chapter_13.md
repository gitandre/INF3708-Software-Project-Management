## Chapter 13 Summary - from textbook
Managing stakeholders is the tenth knowledge area in the PMBOK® Guide – Sixth Edition.

Project stakeholder management includes identifying stakeholders, planning stakeholder engagement, managing stakeholder engagement, and monitoring stakeholder engagement.

You cannot perform the other stakeholder management processes until you first identify project stakeholders. Stakeholders can be internal or external to the organization, and they might support or oppose your project. The main output of this process is a stakeholder register.

A stakeholder analysis is a key technique used in planning stakeholder engagement. Some information, such as how to manage relationships with stakeholders, might be sensitive, so it must be handled carefully. A stakeholder management plan describes stakeholder engagement levels, interrelationships, communication requirements, management strategies, and a process for updating the plan.

When managing stakeholder engagement, project managers and their teams must understand various expectations of stakeholders and use their communications and interpersonal skills. It is important to encourage engagement early in a project and have deliverables that require engagement. An important output of this process is updating the issue log—a document used to help track and resolve issues on projects.

It is important to monitor stakeholder engagement by having an open dialogue and tracking deliverables related to engagement.

Several types of software can assist in project stakeholder management. In addition to technologies mentioned in other chapters to improve communications and collaboration, social media can also help in developing relationships with stakeholders. Some project management software applications include features inspired by social media, such as giving “high fives” and posting comment threads.

Be sure to consider how project integration management can differ in agile/adaptive environments.
