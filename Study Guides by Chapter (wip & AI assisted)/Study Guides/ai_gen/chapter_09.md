## Chapter 9 Summary - from textbook
People are the most important assets in organizations and on projects. Therefore, it is essential for project managers to be good human resource managers. They must also make effective use of physical resources.

The major processes of project resource management include planning resources, estimating activity resources, acquiring resources, developing the team, managing the team, and controlling resources.

Psychosocial issues that affect how people work and how well they work include motivation, influence and power, and effectiveness.

Maslow developed a hierarchy of needs that suggests physiological, safety, social, esteem, and self-actualization needs motivate behavior. Once a need is satisfied, it no longer serves as a motivator.

Herzberg distinguished between motivators and hygiene factors. Hygiene factors such as larger salaries or a more attractive work environment will cause dissatisfaction if not present, but do not motivate workers to do more if present. Achievement, recognition, the work itself, responsibility, and growth are factors that contribute to work satisfaction and motivating workers.

McClelland proposed the acquired-needs theory, suggesting that a person’s needs are acquired or learned over time and shaped by their life experiences. The three types of acquired needs are a need for achievement, a need for affiliation, and a need for power.

McGregor developed Theory X and Theory Y to describe different approaches to managing workers, based on assumptions of worker motivation. Research supports the use of Theory Y, which assumes that people see work as natural and indicates that the most significant rewards are the satisfaction of esteem and self-actualization needs that work can provide. According to Ouchi’s Theory Z, workers can be trusted to do their jobs to their utmost ability as long as management supports them and looks out for their well-being. Theory Z emphasizes job rotation, broadening of skills, generalization versus specialization, and the need for continuous training of workers.

Thamhain and Wilemon identified nine influence bases available to project managers: authority, assignment, budget, promotion, money, penalty, work challenge, expertise, and friendship. Their research found that project success is associated with project managers who use work challenge and expertise to influence workers. Project failure is associated with placing too much emphasis on authority, money, or penalty.

Power is the ability to influence behavior to get people to do things they would not otherwise do. The five main types of power are coercive power, legitimate power, expert power, reward power, and referent power.

Project managers can use Stephen Covey’s seven habits of highly effective people to help themselves and project teams become more effective. The seven habits include being proactive; beginning with the end in mind; putting first things first; thinking win/win; seeking first to understand, then to be understood; achieving synergy; and sharpening the saw. Using empathic listening is a key skill of good project managers.

Emotional intelligence is also an important concept. It involves knowing and managing one’s own emotions and those of others for improved performance.

## Review Questions - Answers

1. Different organizational structures, such as matrix, functional, and projectized, have varying implications on software project management. For instance, in a matrix structure, project managers may have to coordinate with multiple department heads, which can complicate resource allocation and decision-making.
  
2. Project Management Information Systems (PMIS) are crucial as they assist in planning, tracking, and executing software projects. They help in creating schedules, allocating resources, and providing real-time updates, thus aiding in making informed decisions.

3. Agile methodologies offer flexibility, quicker iterations, and customer-focused development, making them invaluable in modern software project management.

4. Effective communication and collaboration are vital as they ensure that everyone involved in the project is aligned with its objectives. Poor communication can lead to misunderstandings, delays, and ultimately, project failure.

## Exercises - Answers

1. Conflict resolution techniques suitable for software project management include negotiation, mediation, and, as a last resort, escalation to higher authority.

2. One well-known software project that failed due to poor communication was the Denver Airport Baggage System. Lack of proper communication among stakeholders led to misunderstandings and ultimately, to the failure of the project. The lesson learned is the importance of clear, timely communication and setting realistic expectations.

3. Features expected in a PMIS tailored for software projects would include task tracking, version control, real-time collaboration tools, and risk assessment modules.

4. In a role-play meeting, identify the project manager, software developers, QA teams, and department heads. Discuss the project requirements, deadlines, and resource allocation. Potential conflicts might arise regarding deadlines and resource constraints, which can be resolved through negotiation and perhaps, re-evaluation of the project scope.
