## Key Terms

- **Schedule Management**: The process of creating, maintaining, and controlling a timeline for project tasks.
- **Time Estimation**: Methods used to approximate the amount of time it will take to complete project tasks.
- **Critical Path Method (CPM)**: A project modeling technique for calculating the minimum completion time.
- **Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT)**: A statistical tool that estimates project durations by using a weighted average of optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely estimates.
- **Contingency Plans**: Backup plans designed to address specific risks that might impact the schedule.

## Calculations

### Critical Path Method (CPM)

- **Definition**: Used to calculate the minimum completion time of a project by identifying the longest path of tasks.
- **Formula**: \( \text{Critical Path} = \text{Sum of durations of tasks on the longest path} \)
- **Units**: Time (e.g., Days, Weeks)
- **Variables**: 
  - Duration = Time required to complete a task (Time)

### Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT)

- **Definition**: Used to estimate project durations using a weighted average of optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely estimates.
- **Formula**: \( \text{PERT Estimate} = \frac{{\text{Optimistic} + 4 \times \text{Most Likely} + \text{Pessimistic}}}{6} \)
- **Units**: Time (e.g., Days, Weeks)
- **Variables**: 
  - Optimistic = Shortest time to complete a task (Time)
  - Most Likely = Most probable time to complete a task (Time)
  - Pessimistic = Longest time to complete a task (Time)

## Chapter 6 Summary - from textbook
Project schedule management is often cited as the main source of conflict on projects. Most IT

projects exceed time estimates. The main processes involved in project schedule management include planning schedule management, defining activities, sequencing activities, estimating activity durations, developing the schedule, and controlling the schedule.

Planning schedule management involves determining the policies, procedures, and documentation that will be used for planning, executing, and controlling the project schedule.

The main output is a schedule management plan.

Defining activities involves identifying the specific activities that must be completed to produce the project deliverables. It usually results in a more detailed WBS.

Sequencing activities determines the relationships or dependencies between activities.

Three reasons for creating relationships are that they are mandatory based on the nature of the work, discretionary based on the project teamâ€™s experience, or external based on non-project activities. Activity sequencing must be done in order to use critical path analysis.

Network diagrams are the preferred technique for showing activity sequencing. The two methods used to create these diagrams are the arrow diagramming method and the precedence diagramming method. There are four types of relationships between tasks: finish-to-start, finish-to-finish, start-to-start, and start-to-finish.

Estimating activity durations creates estimates for the amount of time it will take to complete each activity. These time estimates include the actual amount of time worked plus elapsed time.

Developing the schedule uses results from all of the other project schedule management processes to determine the start and end dates for the project. Project managers often use Gantt charts to display the project schedule. Tracking Gantt charts show planned and actual schedule information.

The critical path method predicts total project duration. The critical path for a project is the series of activities that determines the earliest completion date for the project. It is the longest path through a network diagram. If any activity on the critical path slips, the whole project will slip unless the project manager takes corrective action.

Crashing and fast tracking are two techniques for shortening project schedules. Project managers and their team members must be careful about accepting unreasonable schedules, especially for IT projects. There is a practical limit to shortening schedules of about 25 percent, and it almost always increases project cost and risk.

Critical chain scheduling is an application of the Theory of Constraints (TOC) that uses critical path analysis, resource constraints, and buffers to help meet project completion dates.

The Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) is a network analysis technique used to estimate project duration when there is a high degree of uncertainty about the individual activity duration estimates. PERT uses optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic estimates of activity durations. PERT is seldom used today.

## Review Questions - Answers

1. Schedule management involves creating, maintaining, and controlling a timeline for project tasks. It is crucial because poor scheduling can lead to project delays and cost overruns.
2. CPM helps to identify the longest path of tasks in a project and calculates the minimum completion time. It is significant for optimizing resource allocation.
3. PERT uses a weighted average of optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely time estimates to predict task durations. It helps in accounting for uncertainties in time estimates.
4. Contingency plans are backup strategies designed to address specific risks that might impact the schedule. They help in proactive risk management.
5. Common challenges in schedule management include resource constraints, requirement changes, and unforeseen risks.

## Exercises - Answers

1. 
  - Minimum time using CPM: 5 days + 10 days + 15 days = 30 days
  
2. 
  - PERT estimate: \( \frac{{2 + 4 \times 3 + 4}}{6} = \frac{16}{6} \approx 2.67 \) days
  
3. A software upgrade project failed to meet its deadline due to poor schedule management, resulting in financial losses for the company.
  
4. In a role-play meeting, discuss various risks that could impact the project schedule and develop contingency plans for each.
