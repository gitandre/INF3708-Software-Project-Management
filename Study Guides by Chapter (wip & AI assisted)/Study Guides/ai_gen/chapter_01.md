## My study notes:

#### 9 advantages of using project management techniques are as follows:

1. Better control of financial, physical, and human resources
2. Improved customer relations
3. Shorter development times
4. Lower costs and improved productivity
5. Higher quality and increased reliability
6. Higher profit margins
7. Better internal coordination
8. Positive impact on meeting strategic goals
9. Higher worker morale

#### What is a project?
A project is “a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or
result.”

####  7 attributes of a project:

1. Unique Purpose: Every project has a specific, well-defined objective.

2. Temporary: Projects have a definite start and end date.

3. Drives Change and Value Creation: Projects initiate change to fulfill a need or desire, moving from a current state to a desired future state.

4. Progressive Elaboration: Projects start broad and get more detailed as they progress. They should be developed incrementally.

5. Resource-Intensive: Projects need various resources like people, hardware, and software, often from different departments.

6. Primary Customer or Sponsor: Projects need a main sponsor for direction and funding. Executive support is crucial.

7. Involves Uncertainty: Projects face uncertainty in defining objectives, time estimates, and costs. External factors can also introduce uncertainty.

### The Triple Constraint
The Triple Constraint in project management consists of the following three items:

1. **Time**: The schedule or deadline for completing the project.
  
2. **Cost**: The budget allocated for executing the project.

3. **Scope**: The specific deliverables and tasks that must be completed to finish the project.

These three factors are interdependent, meaning a change in one often impacts the others. Managing the Triple Constraint effectively is crucial for project success.

###  The Quadruple Constraint
The Quadruple Constraint adds a fourth dimension to the traditional Triple Constraint in project management. Alongside Time, Cost, and Scope, the Quadruple Constraint includes:

4. **Quality**: This refers to the standards that the project’s deliverables should meet. Quality may involve performance, reliability, and other critical factors that the client or stakeholders expect.

The Quadruple Constraint recognizes that maintaining the quality of work is equally important as meeting time, cost, and scope objectives. Balancing all four elements is crucial for delivering a successful project.

###  The Project Management Framework
#### A. Stakeholders
The stakeholders/customers needs

#### B. Knowledge Areas
The Project Management Institute (PMI) defines 10 knowledge areas within the framework of project management, as described in the PMBOK (Project Management Body of Knowledge):

1. **Project Integration Management**: This area focuses on coordinating all parts of a project. It includes tasks like developing project charters, project management plans, and directing and managing work.

### The role of the project manager
The key responsibilities of a project manager include business analysis, requirements gathering, project planning, budget estimating, development, testing, and implementation. They are also responsible for monitoring projects from initiation through delivery, ensuring completion of the project on schedule. Additionally, project managers need to have good soft skills such as effective communication, leadership, motivation, negotiation, conflict management, and problem-solving.

The key skills required for a project manager include strategic thinking and being a strategic business partner, encouraging and recognizing valuable contributions, respecting and motivating stakeholders, being fully vested in success, stressing integrity and accountability, and being able to work in ambiguous situations. It is also important for project managers to continue developing their knowledge and experience in project management, general management, soft skills, and the industries they support.

### Leadership Styles
#### PMBOK Leadership

The PMBOK (Project Management Body of Knowledge) identifies various leadership styles that project managers can adopt. These include:

1. **Autocratic**: The project manager makes decisions without soliciting input from team members.
2. **Consultative**: The project manager consults team members before making a decision but retains the final say.
3. **Consensus**: The project manager allows the team to make the decision, usually through a majority vote.
4. **Charismatic**: The project manager uses their charm and personality to influence the team.
5. **Transactional**: The project manager sets clear roles and rewards or penalizes team members based on performance.
6. **Transformational**: The project manager motivates the team through a shared vision and enthusiasm.

#### Goleman's Leadership Styles

Daniel Goleman, a psychologist and author, has identified six leadership styles:

1. **Coercive**: The leader demands compliance from team members.
2. **Authoritative**: The leader sets a vision and motivates the team to follow.
3. **Affiliative**: The leader focuses on creating emotional bonds and harmony.
4. **Democratic**: The leader builds consensus through participation.
5. **Pacesetting**: The leader sets high standards for performance and exemplifies them himself/herself.
6. **Coaching**: The leader focuses on the personal development of team members.

Both PMBOK and Goleman's leadership styles offer a range of approaches that can be beneficial in various project scenarios. The choice of leadership style can depend on the project's needs, the team's characteristics, and the overall organizational culture.

#### Ethics
Many project managers adhere to ethical agreements or codes of ethics established by professional organizations such as the Project Management Institute (PMI) or the International Project Management Association (IPMA). These ethical guidelines often include the following key areas:

### Honesty and Integrity
- Project managers are expected to provide accurate information and not deceive stakeholders or team members.

### Responsibility
- They should take ownership of their decisions and actions, as well as their consequences.

### Respect
- They are expected to treat team members, clients, and all stakeholders with professional respect.

### Fairness
- Project managers should make decisions and act impartially and objectively, ensuring fair treatment for all.

### Transparency
- Open communication is valued, and project managers should keep stakeholders informed of project status, risks, and changes.

### Compliance with Laws
- They should adhere to all laws and regulations governing their work and their projects.

### Confidentiality
- Project managers should respect the confidentiality of information and not use it for personal gain.

### Professionalism
- They are expected to continually develop their skills and apply them appropriately.

Each organization may have its own specific ethical guidelines, but these are some of the universal themes that most project managers are expected to adhere to.

## Chapter 1 Summary - direct from textbook
Many people and organizations have a new or renewed interest in project management as the number of projects continues to grow and their complexity continues to increase. The success rate of IT projects has more than doubled since 1995, but still only about one-third are successful in meeting scope, time, and cost goals. Using a more disciplined approach to managing projects can help projects and organizations succeed.

A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result. An IT project involves the use of hardware, software, and networks. Projects are unique, temporary, and developed incrementally; they require resources, have a sponsor, and involve uncertainty. The triple constraint of project management refers to managing the scope, time, and cost dimensions of a project. It is important to address these dimensions as well as other constraints (such as quality, resources, and risks) and to satisfy the project sponsor.

Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet project requirements. Stakeholders are the people involved in or affected by project activities. A framework for project management includes the project stakeholders, project management knowledge areas, and project management tools and techniques. The 10

knowledge areas are project integration management, scope, schedule, cost, quality, resource, communications, risk, procurement, and stakeholder management. There are many tools and techniques in each knowledge area. There are different ways to define project success, and project managers must understand the criteria that define success for their unique projects.

A program is a group of related projects, subsidiary programs, and program activities managed in a coordinated way to obtain benefits and control that are not available from managing the projects individually. Project portfolio management involves organizing and managing projects and programs as a portfolio of investments that contribute to the entire enterprise’s success. Portfolio management emphasizes meeting strategic goals, while project management focuses on tactical goals. Studies show that user involvement is crucial to project success, as are other factors like executive support and clear business objectives.

Project managers play a key role in helping projects and organizations succeed. They must perform various job duties, possess many skills, and continue to develop skills in project management, general management, and their application area, such as IT. Soft skills, especially leadership, are particularly important for project managers.

The profession of project management continues to grow and mature. In the United States, the military took the lead in project management and developed many tools such as Gantt charts and network diagrams, but today people use project management in virtually every industry around the globe. The Project Management Institute (PMI) is an international professional society that provides several certifications and upholds a code of ethics. Today, hundreds of project management software products are available to assist people in managing projects.
