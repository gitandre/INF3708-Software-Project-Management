## Chapter 2 Summary - from textbook
Projects operate in an environment broader than the project itself. Project managers need to take a systems approach in order to successfully manage projects; they need to consider projects within the greater organizational context. To ensure project success, IT project managers need to integrate business and organizational issues as well as technology into project planning.

Organizations have four different frames: structural, human resources, political, and symbolic.

Project managers need to understand all of these aspects of organizations to be successful.

The structural frame focuses on different groups’ roles and responsibilities to meet the goals and policies set by top management. The human resources frame focuses on producing harmony between the needs of the organization and the needs of people. The political frame addresses organizational and personal politics. The symbolic frame focuses on symbols and meanings.

The structure of an organization has strong implications for project managers, especially regarding the amount of authority they have. The three basic organizational structures are functional, matrix, and project. Project managers have the most authority in a pure project organization, an intermediate amount of authority in a matrix organization, and the least amount of authority in a pure functional organization.

Organizational culture also affects project management. Projects are more likely to succeed in a culture where employees have a strong identity with the organization, where work activities emphasize groups, and where there is strong unit integration, high risk tolerance, performance-based rewards, high conflict tolerance, an open-systems focus, and a balance among the dimensions of people focus, control, and means orientation.

Project stakeholders are individuals and organizations who are actively involved in the project or whose interests may be positively or negatively affected by the project’s execution or successful completion. Project managers must identify and understand the different needs of all stakeholders involved with their projects.

Top management commitment is crucial for project success. Because projects often affect many areas in an organization, top management must assist project managers if they are to do a good job of project integration. Organizational commitment to IT is also important to the success of IT projects. Development standards and guidelines assist most organizations in managing projects.

A project life cycle is a collection of phases. Traditional project phases include concept, development, implementation, and closeout. Projects often develop products, which follow product life cycles. Project managers must understand the specific life cycles of their products as well as the general project life cycle model.

A project should successfully pass through each project phase in order to continue to the next phase. A management review should occur at the end of each project phase, and more frequent management inputs are often needed. These management reviews and inputs are important for keeping projects on track and determining if projects should be continued, redirected, or terminated.

Project managers need to consider several factors affected by the unique context of IT projects. The diverse nature of these projects and the wide range of business areas and technologies involved make IT projects especially challenging to manage.
