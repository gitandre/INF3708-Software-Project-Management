## Key Terms

- **Economic Feasibility**: Evaluation of a project's financial viability.
- **Risk Assessment**: Systematic process of evaluating the potential risks that may be involved in a projected activity or undertaking.
- **Net Present Value (NPV)**: A financial metric used in capital budgeting to evaluate the profitability of an investment or project.
- **Risk Priority Number (RPN)**: A metric used to prioritize risks based on their severity, occurrence, and detection.
- **Discount Rate**: The interest rate used in calculating the present value of future cash flows.
- **Cash Flows**: The net amount of cash being transferred in and out during a particular period.

## Calculations

### Net Present Value (NPV)

- **Definition**: Used in economic feasibility to evaluate the profitability of an investment or project.
- **Formula**: NPV = Sum of (Rt / (1 + i) ^ t) for t from 0 to n
- **Units**: Currency (e.g., Dollars, Pounds, Euros)
- **Variables**: 
  - Rt = Cash inflow or outflow at time t (Currency)
  - i = Discount rate (Percentage)
  - t = Time period (Years)
  - n = Total number of time periods (Years)

### Risk Priority Number (RPN)

- **Definition**: Used in risk assessment to prioritize risks based on their severity, occurrence, and detection.
- **Formula**: RPN = Severity (S) x Occurrence (O) x Detection (D)
- **Units**: Score (unitless)
- **Variables**: 
  - S = Severity of the risk (Score)
  - O = Occurrence likelihood (Score)
  - D = Detection difficulty (Score)

## Summary

Chapter 3 delves into the economic feasibility of projects and risk assessment. It emphasizes the importance of evaluating a project's financial viability using metrics like Net Present Value (NPV). The chapter also discusses risk management strategies and introduces the concept of Risk Priority Number (RPN) for prioritizing risks.

## Chapter 3 Summary - from textbook
Project management involves a number of interlinked processes. The five project management process groups are initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing. These processes occur at varying levels of intensity throughout each phase of a project, and specific outcomes are produced as a result of each process. Normally the executing processes require the most resources and time, followed by the planning processes. Spending adequate time in planning pays off in execution.

Mapping the main activities of each project management process group into the 10 project management knowledge areas provides a big picture of what activities are involved in project management.

It is important to tailor project management methodologies to meet an organization’s particular needs. Some organizations develop their own IT project management methodologies, often using the standards in the PMBOK® Guide as a foundation. Popular methods like PRINCE2, Agile, RUP, and Six Sigma include project management processes.

The JWD Consulting case study demonstrates how one organization managed an IT project from start to finish. The case study provides samples of outputs produced for initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing:

•Business case

•Stakeholder register

•Stakeholder management strategy

•Project charter

•Kick-off meeting agenda

•Team charter

•Work breakdown structure

•Gantt chart

•List of prioritized risks

•Milestone report

•Progress report

•Lessons-learned report

•Final project report

The second version of the same case study illustrates how to use Scrum, the leading agile method, to manage the project. Instead of releasing the new intranet software just once near the end of the project, the team could release three iterations of the software. This version of the case study introduced some new tools, including a product backlog, sprint backlog, and burndown chart. Later chapters provide detailed information for creating these and other project management documents and using several of the tools and techniques described in both versions of this case study.

---

## Exercises

1. Calculate the NPV for a project given a discount rate of 5% and cash inflows of $1000, $2000, and $3000 over three years.
2. Discuss a project that faced significant risks and how those risks were managed.
3. Research a project that failed due to poor economic feasibility. Explain what went wrong.
4. Role-play a risk assessment meeting and prioritize risks using RPN.

---

## Review Questions - Answers

1. Economic feasibility is the evaluation of a project's financial viability. It is often evaluated using financial metrics such as NPV.
2. NPV is a financial metric that calculates the present value of all future cash flows of a project. It's used to evaluate the profitability of an investment or project.
3. RPN is a numeric assessment that helps prioritize risks based on their severity, occurrence, and detection. It is calculated using the formula RPN = S x O x D.
4. Common risk management strategies include risk avoidance, risk reduction, risk sharing, and risk retention.
5. Risks are prioritized using metrics such as RPN which takes into account severity, occurrence, and detection.

## Exercises - Answers

1. 
  - First year: NPV = $1000 / (1 + 0.05) = $952.38
  - Second year: NPV = $2000 / (1 + 0.05)^2 = $1814.06
  - Third year: NPV = $3000 / (1 + 0.05)^3 = $2593.85
  - Total NPV = $952.38 + $1814.06 + $2593.85 = $5360.29

2. In the healthcare sector, a software project to develop an electronic health record system faced significant data security risks. These risks were managed through encryption, multi-factor authentication

, and regular audits.

3. A smartphone application project failed due to poor economic feasibility. The NPV was not considered, and the project ran out of funds before completion.

4. In a role-play risk assessment meeting, identify the project manager, stakeholders, and discuss various project risks. Prioritize them using RPN. For instance, if a risk has an RPN of 64 and another has an RPN of 48, the first risk would be prioritized.
