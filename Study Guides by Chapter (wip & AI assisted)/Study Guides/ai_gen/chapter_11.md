## Chapter 11 Summary - from textbook
Risk is an uncertainty that can have a negative or positive effect on meeting project objectives.

Many organizations do a poor job of project risk management, if they do any at all. Successful organizations realize the value of good project risk management.

Risk management is an investment; in other words, costs are associated with identifying risks, analyzing those risks, and establishing plans to address them. Those costs must be included in cost, schedule, and resource planning.

Risk utility or risk tolerance is the amount of satisfaction or pleasure received from a potential payoff. Risk seekers enjoy high risks, risk-averse people do not like to take risks, and risk-neutral people seek to balance risks and potential payoff.

Project risk management is a process in which the project team continually assesses what risks may negatively or positively affect the project, determines the probability of such events occurring, and determines the impact if such events occur. Risk management also involves analyzing and determining alternate strategies to deal with risks. The processes of risk management are planning risk management, identifying risks, performing qualitative risk analysis, performing quantitative risk analysis, planning risk responses, implementing risk responses, and monitoring risks.

Planning risk management is the process of deciding how to approach risk management activities and plan for them in a project. Contingency plans are predefined actions that a project team will take if an identified risk event occurs. Fallback plans are developed for risks that have a high impact on meeting project objectives and are implemented if attempts to reduce the risk are not effective. Contingency reserves or contingency allowances are provisions held by the project sponsor or organization to reduce the risk of cost or schedule overruns to an acceptable level.

IT projects often involve several risks, including lack of user involvement, lack of executive management support, unclear requirements, and poor planning. Lists developed by the Standish Group and other organizations can help you identify potential risks on IT projects.

A risk breakdown structure is a useful tool that can help project managers consider potential risks in different categories. Lists of common risk conditions in project management knowledge areas can also be helpful in identifying risks, as can techniques such as brainstorming, the Delphi technique, interviewing, and SWOT analysis. A risk register is a document that contains results of various risk management processes; it is often displayed in a table or spreadsheet format. A risk register is a tool for documenting potential risk events and related information.

Risk events refer to specific, uncertain events that may occur to the detriment or enhancement of the project.

Risks can be assessed qualitatively and quantitatively. Tools for qualitative risk analysis include a probability/impact matrix and the Top Ten Risk Item Tracking technique. Tools for quantitative risk analysis include decision trees and Monte Carlo simulation. Expected monetary value (EMV) uses decision trees to evaluate potential projects based on their expected value.

Simulations are a more sophisticated method for creating estimates to help you determine the likelihood of meeting specific project schedule or cost goals. Sensitivity analysis is used to show the effects of changing one or more variables on an outcome.
