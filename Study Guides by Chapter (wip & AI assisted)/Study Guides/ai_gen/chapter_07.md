## Chapter 7 Summary - from textbook
Project cost management is traditionally a weak area of IT projects. IT project managers must acknowledge the importance of cost management and take responsibility for understanding basic cost concepts, cost estimating, budgeting, and cost control.

Project managers must understand several basic principles of cost management to be effective in managing project costs. Important concepts include profits and profit margins, life cycle costing, cash flow analysis, sunk costs, and learning curve theory.

Planning cost management involves determining the policies, procedures, and documentation that will be used for planning, executing, and controlling project cost. The main output of this process is a cost management plan.

Estimating costs is a very important part of project cost management. There are several types of cost estimates, including rough order of magnitude (ROM), budgetary, and definitive.

Each type of estimate is done during different stages of the project life cycle, and each has a different level of accuracy. Several tools and techniques can help you develop cost estimates, including analogous estimating, bottom-up estimating, parametric estimating, and computerized tools. Function point analysis can also be used to estimate software development costs.

Determining the budget involves allocating costs to individual work items over time. It is important to understand how particular organizations prepare budgets so estimates are made accordingly.

Controlling costs includes monitoring cost performance, reviewing changes, and notifying project stakeholders of changes related to costs. Many basic accounting and finance principles relate to project cost management. Earned value management is an important method used for measuring project performance. Earned value management integrates scope, cost, and schedule information. Project portfolio management allows organizations to collect and control an entire suite of projects or investments as one set of interrelated activities.

Several software products can assist with project cost management. Project 2016 has many cost management features, including earned value management. Enterprise project management software and portfolio management software can help managers evaluate data on multiple projects.

Be sure to consider how project cost management can differ in agile/adaptive environments.
