## Chapter 1 Summary - from textbook
Many people and organizations have a new or renewed interest in project management as the number of projects continues to grow and their complexity continues to increase. The success rate of IT projects has more than doubled since 1995, but still only about one-third are successful in meeting scope, time, and cost goals. Using a more disciplined approach to managing projects can help projects and organizations succeed.

A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result. An IT project involves the use of hardware, software, and networks. Projects are unique, temporary, and developed incrementally; they require resources, have a sponsor, and involve uncertainty. The triple constraint of project management refers to managing the scope, time, and cost dimensions of a project. It is important to address these dimensions as well as other constraints (such as quality, resources, and risks) and to satisfy the project sponsor.

Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet project requirements. Stakeholders are the people involved in or affected by project activities. A framework for project management includes the project stakeholders, project management knowledge areas, and project management tools and techniques. The 10

knowledge areas are project integration management, scope, schedule, cost, quality, resource, communications, risk, procurement, and stakeholder management. There are many tools and techniques in each knowledge area. There are different ways to define project success, and project managers must understand the criteria that define success for their unique projects.

A program is a group of related projects, subsidiary programs, and program activities managed in a coordinated way to obtain benefits and control that are not available from managing the projects individually. Project portfolio management involves organizing and managing projects and programs as a portfolio of investments that contribute to the entire enterpriseâ€™s success. Portfolio management emphasizes meeting strategic goals, while project management focuses on tactical goals. Studies show that user involvement is crucial to project success, as are other factors like executive support and clear business objectives.

Project managers play a key role in helping projects and organizations succeed. They must perform various job duties, possess many skills, and continue to develop skills in project management, general management, and their application area, such as IT. Soft skills, especially leadership, are particularly important for project managers.

The profession of project management continues to grow and mature. In the United States, the military took the lead in project management and developed many tools such as Gantt charts and network diagrams, but today people use project management in virtually every industry around the globe. The Project Management Institute (PMI) is an international professional society that provides several certifications and upholds a code of ethics. Today, hundreds of project management software products are available to assist people in managing projects.
