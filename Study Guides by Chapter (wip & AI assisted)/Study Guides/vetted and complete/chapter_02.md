## Chapter 2 Summary - from textbook

**Projects** operate in an environment broader than the **project** itself. **Project managers** need to take a **systems approach** to successfully **manage projects**. They need to consider **projects** within the greater **organizational context**. To ensure **project success**, **IT project managers** must **integrate business and organizational issues** as well as **technology** into **project planning**.

**Organizations** have four different **frames**: **structural**, **human resources**, **political**, and **symbolic**. **Project managers** need to understand all these aspects of **organizations** to be successful. The **structural frame** focuses on different groups' **roles and responsibilities** to meet the **goals and policies set by top management**.

The **human resources frame** focuses on harmony between the needs of the organization and the needs of people. The **political frame** addresses **organizational and personal politics**. The **symbolic frame** focuses on symbols and meanings.

The structure of an **organization** has strong implications for **project managers**, especially regarding the amount of **authority** they have. **Organizational culture** also affects **project management**. **Projects** are more likely to succeed in a culture where **work activities emphasize groups**, and there is **strong unit integration**, **high risk tolerance**, and **performance-based rewards**.

**Project stakeholders** are individuals and organizations who are actively involved in the **project**. **Top management commitment** is crucial for **project success**. **Organizational commitment to IT** is also important to the **success of IT projects**.

A **project life cycle** is a collection of phases, including **concept, development, implementation,** and **close-out**. **Project managers** must understand both **product life cycles** and the **general project life cycle model**. A **project** should successfully pass through each **project phase** to continue to the next phase. 

**Project managers** need to consider several factors affected by the unique context of **IT projects**. The diverse nature of these projects and the wide range of **business areas and technologies** involved make **IT projects** especially challenging to manage.

Several recent trends have affected **IT project management**, including increased **globalization**, **outsourcing**, **virtual teams**, and **agile project management**. **Project managers** must stay abreast of these and other trends and discover ways to use them effectively.
