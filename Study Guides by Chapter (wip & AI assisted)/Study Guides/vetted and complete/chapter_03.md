## Calculations

### Net Present Value (NPV)

- **Definition**: Used in economic feasibility to evaluate the profitability of an investment or project.
- **Formula**: NPV = Sum of (Rt / (1 + i) ^ t) for t from 0 to n
- **Units**: Currency (e.g., Dollars, Pounds, Euros)
- **Variables**: 
  - Rt = Cash inflow or outflow at time t (Currency)
  - i = Discount rate (Percentage)
  - t = Time period (Years)
  - n = Total number of time periods (Years)

### Risk Priority Number (RPN)

- **Definition**: Used in risk assessment to prioritize risks based on their severity, occurrence, and detection.
- **Formula**: RPN = Severity (S) x Occurrence (O) x Detection (D)
- **Units**: Score (unitless)
- **Variables**: 
  - S = Severity of the risk (Score)
  - O = Occurrence likelihood (Score)
  - D = Detection difficulty (Score)

## Summary

**Project management** involves a number of interlinked **processes**. The five **project management process groups** are **initiating**, **planning**, **executing**, **monitoring and controlling**, and **closing**. These processes occur at varying levels of intensity throughout each **phase** of a project, and specific **outcomes** are produced as a result of each process. Normally the **executing processes** require the most **resources** and **time**, followed by the **planning processes**. Spending adequate time in planning pays off in execution.

**Mapping** the main activities of each **project management process group** into the **10 project management knowledge areas** provides a big picture of what activities are involved in project management.

It is important to **tailor project management methodologies** to meet an organization’s particular needs. Some organizations develop their own **IT project management methodologies**, often using the **standards** in the **PMBOK® Guide** as a foundation. Popular methods like **PRINCE2**, **Agile**, **RUP**, and **Six Sigma** include project management processes.

The **JWD Consulting case study** demonstrates how one organization managed an **IT project** from start to finish. The case study provides samples of **outputs** produced for **initiating**, **planning**, **executing**, **monitoring and controlling**, and **closing**:
- **Business case**
- **Stakeholder register**
- **Stakeholder management strategy**
- **Project charter**
- **Kick-off meeting agenda**
- **Team charter**
- **Work breakdown structure**
- **Gantt chart**
- **List of prioritized risks**
- **Milestone report**
- **Progress report**
- **Lessons-learned report**
- **Final project report**

The second version of the same case study illustrates how to use **Scrum**, the leading **agile method**, to manage the project. Instead of releasing the new intranet software just once near the end of the project, the team could release three **iterations** of the software. This version of the case study introduced some new **tools**, including a **product backlog**, **sprint backlog**, and **burndown chart**. Later chapters provide detailed information for creating these and other **project management documents** and using several of the **tools and techniques** described in both versions of this case study.
