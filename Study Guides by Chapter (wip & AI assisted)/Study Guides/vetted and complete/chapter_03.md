## 1. Project Management Process Groups

1. **Interconnected Processes**: Project management is an integrative endeavor, where actions in one area often impact other areas. In software projects, these connections could be particularly complex due to rapidly changing technology and requirements.

2. **Triple Constraint**: Trade-offs often need to be made between the project’s scope, time, and cost. In software development, this is especially pertinent when managing feature sets against deadlines and budgets.

3. **Five Key Process Groups**: These are Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing. Each of these is essential in software projects for structured progression and risk management.

4. **Initiating Processes**: These include defining and authorizing a project or a project phase. In software projects, this often involves stakeholder meetings, requirement gatherings, and initial risk assessments.

5. **Planning Processes**: Here, various plans like scope management, schedule, and cost are developed. Planning is particularly crucial in software projects to deal with complexities and interdependencies.

6. **Executing Processes**: These processes are geared towards coordinating people and resources to meet the plans. In a software context, this includes tasks like coding, testing, and stakeholder communication.

7. **Monitoring and Controlling**: These processes are continuous and aim to ensure the project remains on track. In software projects, agile methodologies often integrate these activities within the development cycle for rapid adjustments.

8. **Closing Processes**: These involve the formal acceptance of the project and its orderly end, often overlooked but crucial in software projects for capturing lessons learned and ensuring proper handoff.

9. **Concurrent Processes**: The process groups are not mutually exclusive and often occur concurrently. This is particularly true in agile or hybrid software development methodologies.

10. **Resource Allocation**: Typically, executing tasks require the most resources and time, followed by planning tasks. In software projects, this often varies depending on the development methodology used.

11. **Applicability to Phases or Entire Project**: The process groups can be applied to each major phase or the entire project. In software development, this flexibility allows for adaptation to various methodologies like Waterfall or Agile.

12. **Importance of Planning**: Planning is emphasized as especially important, with data suggesting that better planning leads to more efficient execution. This is especially true in software projects where changes post-implementation can be costly.

13. **Outputs and Deliverables**: Each process group has specific outputs or deliverables. For software projects, these could range from code modules to documentation and client training.

14. **Monitoring and Adaptation**: Monitoring and controlling processes overlap all other process groups, allowing for constant adaptation. This is particularly crucial in software projects due to the fast-paced nature of technology changes.

15. **Closing Documentation**: The importance of formal closing documents like the final project report and lessons-learned report is highlighted. In software projects, these are critical for future maintenance and development.

## Summary

**Project management** involves a number of interlinked **processes**. The five **project management process groups** are **initiating**, **planning**, **executing**, **monitoring and controlling**, and **closing**. These processes occur at varying levels of intensity throughout each **phase** of a project, and specific **outcomes** are produced as a result of each process. Normally the **executing processes** require the most **resources** and **time**, followed by the **planning processes**. Spending adequate time in planning pays off in execution.

**Mapping** the main activities of each **project management process group** into the **10 project management knowledge areas** provides a big picture of what activities are involved in project management.

It is important to **tailor project management methodologies** to meet an organization’s particular needs. Some organizations develop their own **IT project management methodologies**, often using the **standards** in the **PMBOK® Guide** as a foundation. Popular methods like **PRINCE2**, **Agile**, **RUP**, and **Six Sigma** include project management processes.

The **JWD Consulting case study** demonstrates how one organization managed an **IT project** from start to finish. The case study provides samples of **outputs** produced for **initiating**, **planning**, **executing**, **monitoring and controlling**, and **closing**:
- **Business case**
- **Stakeholder register**
- **Stakeholder management strategy**
- **Project charter**
- **Kick-off meeting agenda**
- **Team charter**
- **Work breakdown structure**
- **Gantt chart**
- **List of prioritized risks**
- **Milestone report**
- **Progress report**
- **Lessons-learned report**
- **Final project report**

The second version of the same case study illustrates how to use **Scrum**, the leading **agile method**, to manage the project. Instead of releasing the new intranet software just once near the end of the project, the team could release three **iterations** of the software. This version of the case study introduced some new **tools**, including a **product backlog**, **sprint backlog**, and **burndown chart**. Later chapters provide detailed information for creating these and other **project management documents** and using several of the **tools and techniques** described in both versions of this case study.
